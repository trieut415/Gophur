# Overview:
Gophur is an innovative social media tool that allows businesses and consumers to connect with one another on a personal level. 
Users can select the type of profile they would like to create when they initialize their account. All user information 
is stored safely and securely in an online database. Business profiles can post about their brands and their products/services, 
while personal profiles can interact with these posts as well as with other personal profiles. 

We hope you enjoy our final product! Please e-mail one of the addresses listed above if you have any questions about the project at all. 

Thank you!
